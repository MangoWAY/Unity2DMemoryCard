## Description
As you can see this is a sample memory card game.
In the start scene you can click the setting button to modify the parameters of the game.
- the number of the card.
- the time of one round.
- the speed that the card is turned over.

The rules of the game are easy to understand. You should turn all cards over before time out. 
If you click one card, the card will wait for another card clicked until it has to be turned back. 
Now you have already clicked first card, when you click the second card, the computer will verify those cards. 
If the first card is same as the second then those cards will never be turned back else those cards will be turned
back immediately. 

## Resources
All the resources are in https://www.gamedeveloperstudio.com/. The resources are free to use. 

## Tools Version
I use Unity 2017.1.1f1 to create the project. Because I use Sprite Atlas, a new function in Unity 2017, the lower version may not work.
